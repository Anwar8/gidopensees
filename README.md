# GiD+OpenSees Interface

GiD+OpenSees Interface introduces a long-awaited full graphical interface for the popular open source finite
element software OpenSees (opensees.berkeley.edu) by seamlessly connecting its text-only environment to the
general graphical pre/post processor GiD (gid.cimne.com). It is available as an add-on (aka problemtype) for GiD
and delivered as open source, under the GNU General Public License.

The interface currently provides linear elastic solutions for 1D, 2D and 3D elements and will be subsequently
extended to nonlinear static and dynamic problems as well.

It has been developed in the Lab of R/C and Masonry Structures, School of Civil Engineering, 
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, by T. Kartalis-Kaounis, V. Protopapadakis and T. Papadopoulos,
Dipl. Civil Engineers, under the supervision of V.K. Papanikolaou, Assistant Professor.
